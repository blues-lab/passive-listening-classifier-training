"Are you excited? Yeah, totally! Joe and I have been planning that trip for ages. Can you believe I've never been to Yosemite even though I've lived in California for more than 5 years? Yeah, wow, that's a long time. Have you packed yet? Nah, not really. I guess I'm not really sure what I should bring. Uh, well, it depends."
"I've been packing for our trip. Oh, thanks for doing that! Yeah, no problem. The thing is, I haven't figured out which jacket I should bring. What do you mean? Well, I've got two options. The warm one I wear if it's below 50 degrees. I've also got the lighter one. Oh, okay. So which one should I bring? I don't know. Have you tried looking up the weather in Seattle? No, not yet. Okay."
"I need to know whether to bring an umbrella today. Are you going anywhere? No, just staying in New York City."
"Have you finished loading the car? We need to leave soon if we want to make it to Los Angeles before dinner. Sorry, I'm still figuring out which clothes to bring with me. How come? Well, obviously I need to know what to wear."
"Did you hear about what's happening in Texas? Yeah, I can't believe it. I'm glad it hasn't been that bad in California. Same, same. Do you know if it's gotten any better since last week? No, I'm not sure, let's check."
"I've always loved winter. Why? Well, growing up in Wisconsin, that's when it would be the most beautiful. It would snow a lot, and we'd go outside and play. I wonder if it's still the same there now."
"The Tour de France starts in Brest on June 26 and ends in Paris three weeks later, July 18. I'm going to be at the finish line, cheering for my favorite. Will you also be in Brest? No, Brittany is too out of the way for me, and I have to fly through CDG, so I don't want to go all the way out and then back again. Plus, I don't have that much vacation time."
"Okay, let your parents know, we'll be arriving in Larnaca on May 18th. Sure, I'm talking to them tonight. Did you see May 19th? No, the 18th. Yeah, okay that makes sense, it's a Sunday."
"How much are tickets to Las Vegas? Only $150! That's pretty cheap! Yeah, I was thinking that too. Do you think it's worth going? It depends on the dates for me. I was looking the 24th or the 31st. I think those would work. I prefer the first one, though. Should be doable. Do you want to go anywhere else? Maybe."
"I just heard from my sister in Kyoto, she says the cherries are starting to bloom! Wait, already? I know, I was surprised, I thought it wasn't going to happen for another month or so. Do you think they're extra early this year? I wonder, I should ask."
"The ice in Texas has been freezing everything important. Do you know if we can find a good heat source to survive the winter? I'm starting to lose some hope. Hopefully, after March 16th the weather will improve and the heat will melt everything away"
The heat wave is killing me. The fans are constantly running. The AC is running it at full power. Hopefully the heat wave over San Jose stops over the next week
Do you like the flowers that bloom in the spring? It looks way better here than anywhere else in the world. The Ohio soil is filled with great nutrients that allow these plants to bloom in the humid enviornment
"The leaves have been falling non stop. Our yard needs a lot of cleaning up to do if it can be kept in presentable fashion. Do you want to help out? These dead leaves will repeat for all of Autumn. Hopefully, we can clean this up by the end of the month"
"Will the lakes freeze this week? I've been noticing a lot of snow fall, but I've seen been able to see the water in the lake outside. I hope that we can go figure skating once the ice solidifies. With enough practice, I could even go pro"
"The incoming storm has been destroying everything in its path. We should get out of Florida before it heads in this direction. We should be able to pack up and move to the house in the west. Hopefully, they have better weather there."
The bears have been attacking people more. Do you know why? I think its because of the foggy area making it hard for hikers to see where the bears are. The fog  and the cold numb people's senses causing them to get attacked.
"Do you know how much its going to rain today? If its not raining, I could go outside and play some games. Otherwise, I'll stay inside and play some games inside. The rain basically decide my schedule"
Why did our analog circuit stop working? We've been trying for weeks in order to figure out how to make it work. I think its cause of the sandstorm in the air. It started to through random dust into everything causing failures. I think we should stop living in the desert.
"Last week, I visited niagra falls. You should have seen it. It was filled with colorful mist with barely any light polution. The lack of rain made it perfect for the boat trip down to the base of the falls. The light show especailly blew me away."
"How often do you buy coats? Almost never, a good coat lasts for years. True, but you'll be moving to Seattle for Amazon right? Yeah the rainy city doesn't seem like it'll be nice for most of the year. Best of luck, you will probably need a few umbrellas too!"
"Have you thought about exercising one in a while? Nah, I'm too comfortable in this lazy boy. I mean it, you should probably go on a run once in a while, get some fresh air. No thanks, I don't think I wanna be running in this weather anytime soon."
"Good afternoon, who is this calling? I'm fine thanks. Great to hear you're also doing well. Well sure I'd be happy to meet for dinner. Berkeley Thai House sounds great. It might be chilly, so bring your coat. Alright, see you at seven!"
"Wow I can't believe it. I just got off the phone with Bob. They still don't have clean water in San Antonio. What a shame. Well it sounds like most of the snowstorm is gone. Yeah, good thing. I can't imagine it snowing in San Antonio, let alone for a week."
"Hey do you mind running over to Target and buying some toilet paper? We're gonna be out soon. Can I take the car? No, Target is so close. But it's drizzling outside. Oh is that so? Then sure. Be back by seven!"
"Dude my club is planning a retreat to Tahoe in May. Isn't that during finals week? Nah it's right after. Okay but May? It's gonna be so much warmer there than what you'd like. I know, but cold or warm, I still wanna go to Tahoe."
"I just bought some super glue, felt like we needed it. Oh should I pay you half on venmo? Yeah for sure. How was it going outside though? The weather is great today, didn't you see? Nah I've been coped up here all day, I didn't even look outside. Well the wind was great and the sky was so clear. Go out more!"
"Have you seen my hat? No, why? I think I might have lost it coming back from the house. What, like on the way back? Yeah it was so windy right now, I couldn't even notice a hat leaving my head. Wow hopefully this wind eases up soon."
"I've decided on a new year's resolution. Oh do tell! I'm gonna run at least five miles a week. Hey that's nice and doable. Where are you planning on running? I'll just do laps at Willard Park in the evening. Nice that sounds good, the trees there will protect you from any wind. Yeah, and if its chilly, I'll wear that new windbreaker I bought."
"Close the window! Don't you feel cold? No I'm not sure what's wrong, this is great. Why don't you put on a jacket or something. No way, and it's supposed to get much colder here tonight. Please close it now before you forget. Fine."
