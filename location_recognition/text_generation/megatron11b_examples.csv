"Can you show me what you bought? Okay, I got three donuts, a bag of chips, these zero calorie sodas, pop tarts, and cheese dip. Wow you’re really going for a party aren’t you? Yeah I actually had to drive down south to safe way since Berkeley’s stores didn’t have the dip I wanted. Wow how far down south? I went to Oakland, nothing crazy. Oh by the way, were you able to try out grills to buy? No it was raining in Oakland so I thought it wouldn’t be a great idea to try those out."
"I’ve moved out the bags! How long did that take you? Yeah and did you need help from the neighbors? Oh it was actually a breeze, I didn’t throw them in the recycling though. Why not? I read about how recycling basically doesn’t work for random plastic pieces anymore. Do tell! Basically a few years ago china banned the import of most recyclable small plastics and now most of America’s small recycling plastics go to dumps. Oh geez, and they light those on fire too right? Yeah there’s gonna be so much toxic smoke from that wherever these are burned."
"My mom’s a doctor and she says starting today I’m eligible to get the vaccine. Aw that’s great for you, have you seen any of those vaccine websites yet? I wanna try my turn but I’ve heard it doesn’t give you all that much information. I’ll go on an aggregator website so I can even see what type of vaccine it will be. Great, good luck at midnight and keep refreshing. May the winds be in your favor. Oh nice I see an opening. Where is it? Vallejo. No way, nothing closer, like in Berkeley? Looks like not. Oh well just get it anyways. How will I even get there though? Maybe take a gig car. Hmm yeah that might work. This thing is at like eight o’clock though. Morning? Yeah. That’s gonna be so cold, good luck. Should I even do it? You gotta."
"Show me what you meant about the Hulu ads being too long. Oh sure let me fire up the TV right now, watch how when I load a twenty minute episode, it takes around five minutes in advertisements. Wow that's horrible, I could run laps around the building in that time. Hah how about you instead try running for real? I dunno it's been a while since I ran. I used to do cross country and run for miles every day and now I'm a potato. Don't say that, didn't you run that marathon in Austin a few months ago? Yeah that was so fun, I remember it was so windy. Yeah well that's Austin for you, the climate here is so much better I'm sure. Agreed."
"I had plans to travel. I wanted to visit my best friend. I wanted to write. But if I don't travel now, I might not be able to until summer, which would put me at a real disadvantage in the working world. So I compromised. I booked a workshop. I wanted to come to San Diego this week, but the weather isn't looking great. So, I booked a small three day workshop here and now I'm happily drinking tea in front of the fire with my cat. It's chilly outside, but nice and cozy here and this weekend I get to spend with my best friend (who is back in the US for the holidays)."
"There's clouds in Berkeley today, but I like these two shots. I'm so impressed with the indoor shot where the leaves are smushed together. The plants are filled with spongy air. They almost vibrate with the vertical. These photos were taken yesterday morning. It's still cold, but the rain is working. On my way home I realized I could just walk down to the waterfront and see what the dogs were doing and take the photo there. Turns out we had a great time."
"We need to start looking into the tornado warnings. Dallas has tornados often and the winds here make me feel like there's some bad weather coming. I'm worried about you and your family in Japan. I'm so glad you got through the earthquake OK, and I'm praying for the people who are hurting there. Hey, I'm Linda. I'm a preacher's wife and a mother of six and grandmother of an ever increasing number of adorable babies. I'm not quite an empty nester, but some of my chicks have flown the coop, and the rest are taller than I am. I'm a writer, homeschool mom and church secretary."
"I have to go out for a run but I'm afraid it's gonna rain. It's been raining a lot here in New York City lately. Some people are saying, 'Hey guys, do you guys really want to run into some of these kids?' I always look for something to do. The one thing that never happens is the whole family comes out for the last event."""
"I’ve just been training for three weeks. I’ll come back once I’m fully healthy. How is the weather in Seattle? It’s great. I’ve been wearing short sleeves. Are you feeling that win against the L.A. Galaxy? You had a goal that may have been the best goal of the year. Yes, I was so happy about that. The fans were singing my name. Everybody was happy and I think the team has confidence. When the team’s confident and you know it can make the plays, it gets everyone’s confidence up. When will you come back? Soon."
"How often does it snow in Maryland? We’ve got a two-day window of opportunity. Depending on the track of the storm, we could get snow in the D.C. region this weekend and into Monday. Snow amounts are still in question, but we can at least get an idea of how much it could stick. If it’s a storm like we saw in March of 2013, which dumped 6 inches of snow on D.C. before switching over to a rainstorm, the heaviest snow might only come on Saturday."
"I can just hear you now, ""So where exactly is upstate Michigan again?"" I know, and it sucks. But for me, it's a great place to live. I've put in many reminders on my phone about the daily weather. Chicago's weather can be so unpredictable. Even though I only see the front range from the bedroom window in the morning, I still know what to expect: windy, cold, snowy, icy whatever. It's my normal. It's funny, I only started taking weather reports as a child. My family doesn't really watch much television. Okay, I'm lying, my mother watches hours and hours of news every day."
"Have you looked into the weather in Cleveland lately? I plan on playing pickup basketball here soon. Let's not pretend that there are going to be snowstorms, which doesn't seem like a good place for us. We're just hoping this will lead up more events as far away from home as possible!"
"Excuse me? What did you just say about my home town? Vancouver is amazing, it has great food and great weather. I am glad to live here! What did you think I meant when I said London was in London? You’re right, it isn’t! The truth is that if you find yourself asking the question, “Is London in London?” on the first day of your trip, you are not ready to spend another week here. Yes! Like in Europe, drink your booze before you leave. In many European cities the cocktail menu is arranged according to the time of day, and you can save on sticker shock by knowing that afternoon tipples tend to cost more."
"How often do you get to go boating here? Oh pretty often, it doesn't really rain much near the American River in Sacramento. Too much rain in Seattle. Speaking of which, the Seattle Rowing Club has a pretty good website about their program. I got one of their season's ""coffee club"" posts in my inbox yesterday. It looks like fun. Here's some famous people who were either born and raised here or moved here for a while, or stayed after they became famous."
"We should really invite Jake for the hike next week. He loves that kind of weather. Oh really? How is it gonna be in Nashville? I hear its 110 degrees today. Next time we go to Nashville let’s bring him.” Back to the show – once the show ends, Dolly chats with the EMTs that tended to him and they ask him if he has taken a dump yet. Well, you don’t need to take a dump if you’re in the middle of a concert, but hey, if he needs to go, he will. “I just took a little dump and cleaned myself off so I’ll be all right,” he told them. Gotta love what people put on Facebook! Oh and just so you know, there will be a long road to recovery."
"Dude I have to know the weather every day since I'm pledging this semester. Bay Area weather is pretty predictable man, just make something up. Go live somewhere cold you fucking dipshit. Drive some place I'll never go again with you then? Like…you could do that? Very entertaining message from a fellow Hollis Brown student, except this is our Fucking duty. You know, like library duty. This is when we have to sit there and do nothing and wait for our name to be called so we can sign out and go home. No such thing as library duty though. This is our duty here in Hollis Brown. It is essential to our happiness."
"I'm gonna go to Tilden Golf Course later today, do you know how the weather there will be? And the forecast for this week. A total of 8. I'm gonna try to keep this short and sweet. But first a quick mention of my Mother's Day plans, to be announced a bit later. It involves 4 generations. Yeah, I'll tell you all about it later. But I have one more workday, and then tomorrow, the last day of this three day holiday weekend, I'm gonna come home, see how my dear pets are, and then I'm gonna go to a performance of the Berkeley Community Chorus."
"Let's go shopping for Easter. Sure, where to? Any big store we can stop by in Bakersfield. Cool, how's the weather gonna be there? Not sure, but it's been sunny everywhere so far. How's the traffic going to be? Not much, and the shortest distance to where we're going will be on a Sunday, so the traffic shouldn't be too bad. Cool, it's not even mid-week yet, so we've still got plenty of time to get up, have breakfast, etc. Fun times, huh? Little did I know that my eight-hour drive home would turn into a nearly 13-hour one with nothing but driving as far as Bakersfield and driving through traffic and traffic."
"We have asked Alexa already but it looks like she isn't working. Oh that sucks. I wish I had a weather app right about now. Oh come on just look outside, San Francisco never changes anyways. My battery is pretty low. I can hear it make a lot of noise. I better press the red button. Please don't run out of power. Hesitating to make my decision because my mother is on the other line. Please, for the love of God don't run out of battery. Just checking the weather. In case I ever have to take my phone out. I've been going to check it before I go to sleep, but it takes like 2 minutes. I'm going to delete the app. Oh god I can't delete the app."
"Yesterday I found myself sitting in a high rise overlooking Brickell Key, the island just south of Downtown Miami, drinking a signature cocktail in a beautiful clear blue pool with lifeguards and the ever-present drone of commuter traffic that echoed off of the nearby buildings, as the mid afternoon traffic flowed south and west over the Palmetto Expressway. They were on the roof till two in the morning just celebrating for her birthday party. Didn't they get cold? Cold? This time of year in Miami? Have you seen the weather lately? Not a chance. I was sitting there just taking in the view. I had come here with a group of three business associates from Houston."
